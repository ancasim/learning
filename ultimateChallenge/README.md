#Final Challenge - Intro to PHP Programming

A coffee machine is able to prepare several coffee specialties using three base ingredients: sugar, milk and coffee.
Each coffee type is prepared using a different recipe by combining the base ingredients in different quantities.
Using OOP concepts, create a class structure and design that can be used by an application to manage the coffee machine, being able to provide the following operations and data to the main application:
- Trigger the command to prepare a specific coffee type
- Display a specific error in case one of the ingredients is not in the right quantity
- Check the current quantity of one of the ingredients from the coffee machine

The class design should be created by keeping in mind the possibility that the coffee machine can be upgraded for using other ingredients and preparing other coffee types
